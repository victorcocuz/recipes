- 1 egg

- 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
- 1 small onion, finely grated

- 1/2 teaspoon pepper
- 1 lb medium ground beef

Directions:

 3.Add any of the “stir-ins” that appeal to you.
 4.Crumble in beef& using your hands or a fork, gently mix together.
 5.Handle the meat as little as possible – the more you work it, the tougher it gets.
 6.Gently shape (don’t firmly press) mixture into burgers about ¾ inch thick.
 7.Using your thumb, make a shallow depression in the centre of each burger to prevent puffing up during cooking.
 8.Place burgers on the grill, close lid& BBQ until NO LONGER PINK INSIDE, turning once, about 6 – 8 minutes per side.
 9.An instant read thermometer should read 160F.
